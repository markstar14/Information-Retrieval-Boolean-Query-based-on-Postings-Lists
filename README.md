# Information-Retrieval-Boolean-Query-based-on-Postings-Lists
With a postings list acting as the input, this program goes through the list to find the documents that are the best matches for the search terms given. Multiple different comparison methods are used to determine which is the best strategy.

To run this program, run the code in the same directory as outputs.log, term.idx, and query_file.txt. 

query_file.txt will contain the queries on each line

term.idx is the postings list

outputs.log is the file that will contain all of the output data
